        Hello!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a software engineer from Perth, Western Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        My formal education includes a Bachelor of Actuarial & Applied
        Statistics and a Graduate Certificate of Cyber Security, so I have a
        strong background in mathematics, statistics, and data analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a passion for programming and software development, and
        through my work, personal projects, and involvement in the
        open-source community, I have become a software engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I love working on personal projects and contributing
        to open-source projects online. I have a particular interest in
        Python, but I also enjoy learning new languages such as Rust.
